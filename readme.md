# Python raycaster

###### by Sem van der Hoeven

This is a raycaster I made in python. it uses the `pygame` library for the graphics.

## Installation
Clone the repository by entering `git clone https://github.com/SemvdH/python-raycaster.git` into your command prompt. Then navigate to the folder using `cd python-raycaster`.

If you don't have pygame installed yet, you can install it using `pip install pygame`.

Now you can run the raycaster by entering `python raycaster.py`

## Usage
The first version only has horizontal movement. You can move around using WASD and look left and right using the left and right arrow keys. You can press TAB for a debug mode, but that's only useful for developing things for the raycaster.
